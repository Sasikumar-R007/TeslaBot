TeslaBot – Wireless Power Transmission Rover

TeslaBot is a Bluetooth-controlled robotic rover integrated with a Tesla coil to enable wireless power transmission.
It is built with a vision to solve real-life challenges such as power outages in rural hospitals, which often lead to severe consequences, including loss of lives. By providing a portable wireless power source, TeslaBot aims to support emergency operations and critical healthcare facilities in areas with unreliable electricity.

Additionally, the Tesla coil is entirely made using e-waste materials, making TeslaBot a step toward sustainable innovation and e-waste management—an urgent need in India, which is one of the largest e-waste producers.

Rural Hospitals & Clinics: Emergency power backup during outages.
Disaster Relief Zones: Providing temporary power in flood/earthquake-affected regions.
Defense & Border Areas: Remote energy supply for communication or equipment.
Wireless Charging Experiments: Research and development in modern power systems.
Educational Demonstrations: Showcasing wireless energy and robotics integration.

🔹 Future Scope 🚀

Autonomous Navigation: AI-powered pathfinding to make the rover fully automatic.
Rugged Frame: Strong body design to climb hills, forests, and rough terrains.
Extended Range: Improved wireless power efficiency and coverage.
Modular Design: Attachments for solar charging, payload delivery, or IoT integration.
Scalability: Larger models capable of powering entire rural setups or camps.
Eco-Friendly Development: More use of e-waste and recycled materials.

🔹 Safety Notes ⚠️

Tesla coil produces high voltage – operate with caution.
Keep away from flammable substances and sensitive devices.
Ensure proper insulation and ventilation during operation.
