TeslaBot ‚Äì Wireless Power Transmission Rover

TeslaBot is a Bluetooth-controlled robotic rover integrated with a Tesla coil to enable wireless power transmission.
It is built with a vision to solve real-life challenges such as power outages in rural hospitals, which often lead to severe consequences, including loss of lives. By providing a portable wireless power source, TeslaBot aims to support emergency operations and critical healthcare facilities in areas with unreliable electricity.

Additionally, the Tesla coil is entirely made using e-waste materials, making TeslaBot a step toward sustainable innovation and e-waste management‚Äîan urgent need in India, which is one of the largest e-waste producers.
